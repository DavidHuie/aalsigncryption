A collection of signcryption algorithms for Go.

## Algorithms

### Ahmad-Afzal-Iqbal (AAL)

[Ahmad-Afzal-Iqbal
signcryption](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6725326/) is an
elliptic curve signcryption scheme designed for firewalls. AAL
provides signatures that can be publically verified without revealing
the contents of the ciphertext. In contrast, most signcryption schemes
provide signature verification as part of the decryption process and
not as a separate process.

AAL signcryption provides the following features:
- confidentiality
- message integrity
- signature unforgeability
- non-repudiation
- public verification
- ciphertext-only authentication
- forward secrecy

This version of AAL is implemented with the elliptic curves P256 &
P521, AES counter mode encryption, and SHA-256 for generating keys.

## Protocols

### Signcrypted Transport Layer (STL)

A transport layer similar to TLS that uses AAL signcryption .
