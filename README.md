# signcryption

A collection of signcryption algorithms for Go.

## Algorithms

### AAL

[AAL](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6725326/)
(Ahmad-Afzal-Iqbal) is an elliptic curve signcryption scheme for
firewalls. AAL signcryption provides signatures that can be publically
verified without revealing the contents of the ciphertext. In
contrast, most signcryption schemes provide signature verification as
part of the decryption process and not as a separate process.

AAL signcryption provides the following features:
- confidentiality
- message integrity
- signature unforgeability
- non-repudiation
- public verification
- ciphertext-only authentication
- forward secrecy

This version of AAL is implemented with the elliptic curves P256 &
P521, AES counter mode encryption, and SHA-256 for generating keys.
